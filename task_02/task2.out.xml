				What this Ruling is about
			
			
			
			
				
			
			1. This Ruling explains: 
			
				
					
						&bull; the meaning of the term &lsquo;employer&rsquo; in the general exclusion
						provision provided under the Income from Employment Article, or
						its equivalent,
						
							
							
							The heading of equivalent Articles in other tax treaties
								vary. Consistent with the heading of Article 15 of the OECD
								Model until it changed in 2000, many such Articles are headed
								&lsquo;Dependent Personal Services&rsquo;, for example, Article 15 of the
								Canadian convention. Others may have no heading at all, for
								example, Article 14 of the German agreement and Article 12 of
								the Singaporean agreement.
							
							
						
						of Australia&rsquo;s tax treaties (&lsquo;short-term visit exception&rsquo;;
						
							
							
							Appendix 2 of this Ruling sets out a glossary for some
								terms used in this Ruling: &lsquo;intermediary&rsquo;, &lsquo;international labour
								hire arrangements&rsquo;, &lsquo;short-term visit exception&rsquo; and &lsquo;user
								enterprise&rsquo;.
							
							
						
						) and
					
				
				
					&bull; the approach to be taken in determining who the employer is
						for the purposes of the short-term visit exception.
				
			
			
			
			
			
			
				
			
			2. This Ruling applies to entities that engage
				non-resident individuals to render services in Australia and to
				those non-resident individuals.
